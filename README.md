# 🌍 Social Influence & Community Detection using GNN
> **A Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for analyzing social influence and detecting communities in real-time.**

## 🚀 Project Overview
This Google Colab notebook implements a **Graph Attention Network (GAT)** to analyze **social influence** in a network.  
It integrates **PageRank & Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA)** to rank influential users and detect communities.  
The model is designed for **real-time graph analysis** and can scale with **Apache Spark Streaming**.
